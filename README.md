## Description

The motivation behind this project was to practice and clarify concepts and understanding related to the use of expressJS to deploy a nodeJS based application from the backend. This project forced a very rapid understanding of concepts that were only very lightly touched on previously and tested me greatly. Sepcifically, this project required development of skills in the area of nodeJS, ExpressJS, routes and routing, the filter() method, USE, POST, SEND, GET, various fs methods and more. Although the amount of code required may have been smaller the understanding required was significant.

The new note will then be appear on the sidebar. The user is also able to delete the notes individually by clicking the trashcan next to the title that will use the note's unique id to delete it.
